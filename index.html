  <p style="font-size:3vw;"><b>PROJECT NAME</b></p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">“PRIDE: An NYUAD Film”</p>
  <p style="font-size:3vw;"><b>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</b></p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">This website was made for my group's 30 Minute Film Festival entry called "Pride: An NYUAD Film". The website has also been optimized for all screens, whether it be computer or phone. I aimed at creating an eye-catching, yet equally minimalistic site aimed to explain the website, as well as the current states of the LGBTQ+ community in my groupmate's home countries. I wanted to give the user an easy time to navigate the page, and also give them a few interactive activities along the way.
</b></p>
  <p style="font-size:3vw;"><b>PROCESS</b></p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">I went about this by first creating a navigation page of the three pages: Home, Characters, and Contact Us. The page you are on will be highlighted yellow in the navigation bar. The Home page first shows the title of the video, with an interactive aspect of turning multicolored when you hover on it. Next to the title is a LGBTQ+ flag and sparkles, which adds a dynamic feel to the website.
</p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">The second part of the Home page shows a "MEET THE CAST" section, with my groupmates' photos all in one line, with our name and button under each. When you hover on each photo or button, it will turn grayscale. This serves as a way for the user to go straight to a character's page, instead of going to the Character's page and clicking a specific name. It also shows NYUAD's social media platforms.
</p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">The Characters page of the website allows the user to read about each groupmate one after the other. There is a fixed button that, when clicked, will show the current time in each character's home country. Each page tells a bit about the groupmate's life at NYUAD, as well as how the LGBTQ+ scene is in their country of origin. It also includes an interactive mini game that allows you to guess the country's flag, with a pop-up alert showing if you are wrong or right.</p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">The Contact Us part of the website shows NYUAD's contact information, as well as a small interactive form that allows you to add messages and names. However, since this is only for the assignment, the Submit button will trigger a pop-up alert that says it is only for assignment purposes.</p>
  <p style="font-size:3vw;"><b>REFLECTION/EVALUATION</b></p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">I believe that I exceeded my own expectations in creating this website, and I definitely spent more time on it because I was genuinely interested in creating more. I learned more tricks in HTML, CSS, and Javascript that I will definitely use in the future. Though I had some obstacles such as the responsive resizing of the website to cater to all screens, I am proud of the final result.

  <p style="font-size:2vw;">“Pride (And How To React To Your Child Coming Out)”</p>
  <p style="font-size:3vw;"><b>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</b></p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">The title of our interactive comic is “Pride (And How To React To Your Child Coming Out)”. The plot tells the story of a young man who happily embraces his identity as a homosexual man; however, he still does not know how to tell his parents. After finding a poster for an LGBTQ+ party in his bedroom, the parents confront their son and demand to know the truth.</b></p>
  <p style="font-size:3vw;"><b>PROCESS</b></p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">We aimed to create an educational and immersive experience for the user, which allows them to dive into the perspectives of both the parent and the child. Through not giving the main characters names, it creates a more general experience for the user and allows them to be put in the shoes of the protagonists.  The user is given the choice to be either the boy or the parents, and his/her choices will affect how the plot will play out. In addition, there are some hidden sound effects that can be played throughout the comic when clicked on. </p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">In addition, we wanted to portray how one’s sexual orientation is a big part of their identity. Through only adding color to the rainbow-colored bands and pink glow of those accepting of the LGBTQ+ community, this creates emphasis on the main message of the story. We used Adobe Illustrator to turn the drawings into SVG’s, and often used Adobe Photoshop to tweak the color correction of the photos to make them pop more.</p>
  <p style="font-size:3vw;"><b>REFLECTION/EVALUATION</b></p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">We initially found it difficult to work as a team, considering the time constraint and the inability to meet up in person and talk about our assigned tasks. However, as time went on, we were able to better cooperate with one another and produce our final result.</p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">With Katie working on the drawings and finding the sound effects, Youssef on the storyline and responsiveness of the website, Nurgazy on the general structure of the website, and Yusra with the interactivity and the flow of the website, we were able to work together and meet our goals for the site.</p>

  <p style="font-size:3vw;"><b>PROJECT NAME</b></p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">“FLIGHT: A Turbulent Experience”</p>
  <p style="font-size:3vw;"><b>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</b></p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">This website is an interactive 8D audio experience of a turbulent flight with an overall theme of tragedy. The surround sound effect makes the user experience immersive. An emphasis is placed on the auditory senses whilst ensuring that the visuals do not dominate as much. This was done by creating a minimalistic website with enough features to allow intuitive access to the user.</b></p>
  <p style="font-size:3vw;"><b>PROCESS</b></p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">We started drafting our script for the recording which included conversational dialogue as well as complementary sound effects. We then tested our script by each of us recording their part and then playing them all together with some sound effects we got from YouTube and other free sound platforms to see how long it was. </p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">The visuals were curated with the sole purpose of "complementing" the audio rather than narrate the entire story by itself. There is one single visible picture and it is the background photo of the view of a plane from the back to slightly enhance the experience more. This is the reason why the passengers' faces were not shown, so as not to allow the user to focus their attention to any characters.</p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">Some effects appear on the screen with the progression of the events during the recording to stimulate the attention of the user and draw on their emotions. We made the background turn green when the captain speaks on the microphone, oxygen masks bounce downwards as the emergency situation arises, and the screen shake and tilt as the turbulence worsens. We decided to make the ending open ended to encourage the user to make their own assumptions and engage more with the webpage.</p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">We then decided to stick to our theme of aviation tragedy on the About page by designing an "International Passport'' (coping with the idea of us being global leaders in NYUAD) that was inspired from an image on the Internet, and put our own realistic data inside each of the four copies of the template. We took excerpts from the recording of us respectively and as you hover each of the passports the cursor changes to sound symbol and automatically plays the short audio of each character.</p>
  <p style="font-size:3vw;"><b>REFLECTION/EVALUATION</b></p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">Our goals and expectations were generally met in the process of building the final version of the platform because of the excessive engagement the page induces whilst the user is listening to the recording. We were able to make the sound effects and dialogue seem very realistic and intense and asked many people other than ourselves to make sure that the experience is enjoyable. </p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">The one thing we wished to have done was to have more time because we wanted to have media interviews with one of the passengers. We also had several ideas on how the experience could be enhanced much more using actual animations and by changing the images for each sub-scene in the recording but the project requirements limit us to focusing on just the sound effects rather than visual designing.</p>

  <p style="font-size:2vw;">"VENGEANCE: An NYUAD Film"</p>
  <p style="font-size:3vw;"><b>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</b></p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">VENGEANCE is a joint website and horror film that delves into the potential dangers of social media and hacking. Revolving around the protagonist Zunair Viqar, he is seen to be “Mr. Perfect” and the most popular student at New York High School, Abu Dhabi. The plot takes pace mainly on Zunair’s computer screen, where he has limited control as to how to deal with a supposed “virus” in a Truth or Dare game he plays with his friends.</b></p>
  <p style="font-size:3vw;"><b>PROCESS</b></p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">We first began with recording individual videos of ourselves speaking our lines to account for the possible lagging issues of a real video call. This would ensure that our video was in the best quality it could be, especially considering we are all in different areas of the world. For the editing process, it was mainly a process of incorporating sounds and visuals that gave a feeling of being in a computer screen.
</p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">We combined both “real life” and “on screen” footage to feel as if the protagonist is shifting back and forth between virtual and reality. For creating the website, our group decided to put the atmosphere of a “virus” into the experience. When told that it looked too much like a hacker, we decided that we would mix in the true culprit of the video: social media. Changing the moving background of the video from film dust to glitching icons of various apps such as Snapchat and Vine, we show how social media is turning to something much more than just tools for connection, but something used for blackmail and status.
</p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">The theme of the Cast page was to incorporate the concept of privacy settings in social media and the dangers of hacking. It starts off with the privacy settings on, where you are not able to see the groupmates. However, when you toggle the button off, our headshots are finally seen. When you hover over the pictures, the flipcard shows each groupmate’s Facebook profile in the perspective of the user, as if someone truly hacked into our social media.
</p>
  <p style="font-size:3vw;"><b>REFLECTION/EVALUATION</b></p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">Our goals and expectations were met in the the final version of the website and the video, as it gives the user an interactive experience as if they were the ones controlling the computer themselves. Getting feedback from first-time watchers of the video, they say that the experience was enjoyable to watch as it is a concept that they never really saw on the media.</p>
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">We originally thought that we wouldn’t be able to finish our project in time, considering our situation and that we weren’t able to meet up to film. However, we feel like this pushed our creative boundaries and helped us create something that was unique and future memories.</p>
